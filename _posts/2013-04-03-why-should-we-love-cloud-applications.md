1) It's scalable.
-----------------

Have you ever had digg-effect? Have you ever had an advertisement in national tv right before main news? Than you must know what digg-effect is. If you're not out of badwitch or up/downlink (which happens, 100Mbps is not enough for website's advertisement right before main news) than your server might get out of resources. In cloud computing, cloud is always ready for us. If, by any accident, we're receiving so many guests that our servers are about to be gone, let's use cloud, let's use cloud's resources. They're always available.

2) It's cheaper.
----------------

Imagine that you have to pay $1000 every month for using your car, but you cannot use more than 200l of gas (let's image that gas costs $5/1l). Is it the most optimal way to pay for the gas? Nope. It's quite better to buy it when you need it. For some time (e.g. one yar) you will pay less and, one day, because of for example advertisement, you will buy more resources. In the end, it will end up with more money in your wallet.

3) It's easier.
---------------

This point contains 1) and 2). When your app is getting huge amount of visits unexpectedly, you don't need to call your sysadmin to do something with it. You can trust your data center that they will give you as much resources as you need. Of course, it will end up with bigger receipt for hosting, but... isn't it better than not working service? And remember, it's going to be cheaper.
