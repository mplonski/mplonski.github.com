What's better -- Google or friends?

Well, I'm not going to compare all my friends to Google (search engine, not company). I'm simply fed up with asking friends about everything, just because they might know. Then, what to do if you have some problem with your code?

1) Ask Google.

Seriously, Google knows answers to 92,4% of your questions. It's highly possible that somebody had had the same problem some time before you. It's highly possible that the answer to your question is somewhere in the Internet. It's highly possible that you're going to find that answer in 30s, of course if you're lucky! :-)

2) RTFM.

If Google doesn't know, there're two possibilies. First, your problem is really unique and nobody has ever heard about it. Second, it's so dumb, nobody has asked about it. Read manual (carefully!), check your software (version, etc), read everything. Even if you cannot find any solution to your problem, it might end up with some new, useful knowledge.

3) Ask friends.

Yep, it's the last thing you can do, just before taking brake, making tea & toasts, getting some sleep after 72h of programming and coming back to your problem next day. If your friends are quite advanced in what they do, they are probably getting a lot of dumb questions. Please, give them opportunity to work, and ask them only those questions, to which nobody has the answer. Nobody, even google.
